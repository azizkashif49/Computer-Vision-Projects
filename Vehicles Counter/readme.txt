# Vehicle Counter with YOLO and SORT

This computer vision project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detector and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm to create an efficient vehicle counter in traffic videos.

## Features
- **YOLO Object Detection:** Accurate and real-time vehicle detection using YOLO, allowing the system to identify and track vehicles seamlessly.
- **SORT Tracking:** Implementation of the SORT algorithm ensures robust tracking of detected vehicles, providing a reliable count throughout the video.
- **Traffic Video Analysis:** The project takes input from traffic videos, tracks vehicles, and generates a count of vehicles present in the scene.

## Dependencies
- YOLO v8
- SORT module (https://github.com/abewley/sort/blob/master/sort.py)
